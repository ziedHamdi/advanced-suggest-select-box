This page is dedicated to the css styling of the suggest boxes

The library doesn't include a Resources client bundle since there was no time allocated for that task. However, its css integration is pretty direct: just copy the included css file content to your own project to start working on your design.

To be able to work with the popup content, directly from your browser using FireBug or a silmilar tool, there's a possibility I use to keep the popup open event if I click outside of it, or if I select an element.

To do this, add this line to you onModuleLoad() method:
{{{
  DefaultSuggestionPopup.DEBUG_MODE = true;
}}}
