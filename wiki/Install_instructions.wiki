#This page describes the steps to integrate the current version in your project

= Introduction =
The component is a very standard GWT component, used GWT users will not need to read this document.
Here we describe how to integrate the jar in an eclipse development environment.

= Details =
  #  Download the current [http://code.google.com/p/advanced-suggest-select-box/downloads/list jar] file
  #  Put it in your library folder (next to your other jars: a good practice is to put it inside the project so it can be referenced through a relative url that will avoid additional configuration when getting versions from your svn or other source repository)
  #  Add the jar in your classpath : right click projet > Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries > Ad JARs
  #  In your project's *___.gwt.xml* file add the line
{{{
	<inherits name='eu.nextstreet.gwt.components.IntoGwt' />
}}}

You're done. You can now either use directly the DefaultSuggestBox class, extend it or extend one of the many available extension points.

Have Fun :-)
